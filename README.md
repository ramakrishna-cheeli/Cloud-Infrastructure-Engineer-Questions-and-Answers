- Experience  with Cloud Infrastructure:
  - Managed the migration of a legacy application to AWS, designed the architecture using EC2 instances and an RDS database. Implemented auto-scaling to handle variable traffic and set up Elastic Load Balancing for distribution. Additionally, utilized CloudWatch for monitoring and alarms. This project improved application performance and reduced operational overhead.
- Types of Cloud Computing Platforms:
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, like virtual machines and storage.
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without managing infrastructure.
  - Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance.
- To implement disaster recovery:
  - Identify critical assets and potential risks.
  - Create a recovery plan with backup and restore procedures.
  - Establish off-site data backups and replication.
  - Implement failover systems for high availability.
  - Regularly test the plan and update it as needed.
- To monitor infrastructure performance:
  - Use monitoring tools to track metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage.
  - Set up alerts for thresholds and anomalies.
  - Monitor application response times and user experience.
  - Regularly review logs and analyze trends.
  - Conduct performance tests and optimizations.
- To troubleshoot infrastructure issues:
  - Gather information about the problem and recent changes.
  - Check system logs and monitoring data for anomalies.
  - Test components individually to identify the source.
  - Collaborate with teams and communicate updates.
  - Implement fixes or workarounds, then verify results.
  - Document the issue and solution for future reference.
- Infrastructure as Code(IaC):
  - nfrastructure as Code (IaC) is a crucial concept that greatly improves the efficiency and reliability of managing infrastructure. By defining infrastructure components using code, we can automate the provisioning, scaling, and maintenance processes. This approach ensures consistency, reduces human error, and enables rapid deployment across different environments. IaC also promotes collaboration between development and operations teams and facilitates version control for infrastructure configurations.
- Automation in Infrastructure:
  - Automation is becoming increasingly important for infrastructure management, had experience with a variety of automation tools, such as Ansible, Chef, and Puppet.
- Complex Infrastructure trobleshooting Issue:
  - I encountered a complex issue where a sudden spike in traffic was causing our application to become unresponsive. After analyzing logs and metrics, I identified that a specific database query was becoming a bottleneck. I optimized the query, implemented caching mechanisms, and fine-tuned our load balancer settings. The collaborative effort between our development, database, and infrastructure teams led to resolving the issue and improving overall application performance.
- VM vs Container
  - A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, while a container is a lightweight, isolated environment for running applications and their dependencies. Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than VMs.
- High availability and fault Tolerance:
  - Techniques like setting up instances across multiple availability zones, load balancing, auto-scaling, and implementing database replication or clustering to ensure redundancy and minimize downtime.
- Elastic Load Balancer in AWS:
  - An ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure even load distribution and improve application availability. It performs health checks on instances to route traffic to healthy instances.
- Content Delivery Network:
  - A CDN improves the performance of delivering web content by caching it on servers distributed globally. This reduces latency by serving content from a server closer to the user’s location.
- Troubleshooting a slow performing Application:
  - start by monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network), analyzing logs, conducting performance tests, and utilizing profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
- Network Segmentation:
  - Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to enhance security and performance. It helps contain potential breaches and limits the lateral movement of threats.
- Serverless Computing and Benfits:
  - Serverless computing allows developers to focus solely on writing code without managing server infrastructure. Cloud providers automatically handle scaling and resource allocation based on demand. This reduces operational overhead and costs.
- Design a Cloud Architecture to handle disaster Recovery:
  - design an architecture with data replication across multiple regions, automated backups, and regular data synchronization, use cloud-specific disaster recovery services and implement failover mechanisms to ensure minimal downtime during outages.
- Securing data at rest and in transit in a cloud environment:
  - Data at rest can be secured using encryption mechanisms, like encrypting storage volumes. Data in transit can be secured using SSL/TLS protocols for communication between clients and servers.
- AutoScalling and it's benfits:
  - Autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of instances based on real-time demand. It ensures optimal resource utilization and prevents overprovisioning, which helps maintain application performance and cost efficiency.
- Cloud vendor lock in and how to mitigate its risks;
  - Cloud vendor lock-in refers to the challenge of being tightly dependent on a specific cloud provider’s service. To mitigate risks, you can use cloud-agnostic tools and services, follow open standards, and design architectures that allow for easy migration between cloud providers.
- One of your servers suddenly becomes unresponsive. How would you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:?
  - I would begin by checking system logs and monitoring tools to understand the cause. If it’s a resource issue, I’d look at CPU, memory, and disk usage. If necessary, I might perform a reboot or restart relevant services. If the issue persists, I’d investigate further, considering hardware failures, software conflicts, or recent updates.
- How do you secure sensitive data stored in your infrastructure?
  - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit, use strong authentication mechanisms, apply access controls and permissions, regularly update and patch systems, and follow security best practices.
- Can you describe the process of disaster recovery planning?
  - Disaster recovery planning involves identifying potential risks, creating strategies to mitigate those risks, establishing backup and recovery processes, testing the plan, and regularly updating it.
- Describe the process of migrating an on-premises Exchange server to Exchange Online Exchange Online Migration:
  - Assessing current environment.
  - Setting up Exchange Online account.
  - Creating migration endpoints.
  - Configuring mail flow.
  - Initiating mailbox migration using tools like Exchange Admin Center or PowerShell.
  - Monitoring migration progress.
  - Verifying successful migration and updating DNS records.
  - Decommissioning on-premises Exchange.
